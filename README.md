# 📝 Smart To-Do List Manager

A clean and simple task manager built using **Flask (Python)** for the backend and **HTML + CSS** for the frontend. It helps you create, filter, sort, and manage daily tasks efficiently — with features like priority sorting, overdue detection, and status tracking.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Add New Tasks** (with title, description, due date, and priority)
- 🕐 **Auto-incremented Task ID**
- ⏰ **Overdue Detection** based on current date
- 📅 **Filter Tasks** by:
  - Pending
  - Completed
  - Overdue
  - Due Today / Tomorrow
- 🔽 **Sort by Priority** (High → Low) for incomplete tasks
- 🗑️ **Delete Tasks**
- ✔️ **Mark Tasks as Completed** with timestamp

---

## 💡 How It Works

- The backend is powered by `Flask`, and all tasks are saved locally in `tasks.json`.
- Each task is assigned a unique ID automatically.
- When loading tasks, the app automatically marks old tasks (past due date) as **Overdue** if they’re not completed.
- The UI is built with HTML and inline CSS for quick rendering in the browser.
